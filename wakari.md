#Creating your own IPython Notebook Blog environment on Wakari

* Check to make sure pandoc is available.  You can't convert the notebooks to blog entries without it. Open a terminal in Wakari, and type `which pandoc`.  It should return something, like `/opt/anaconda/bin/pandoc`.   If not found, contact  wakari_support@continuum.io and ask them to install pandoc.

* Go to https://github.com/rsignell-usgs/blog and click the `fork` button to fork the blog repository.
* In a Wakari terminal, make a new directory "blog" and clone your blog repository from github, for example:
```
mkdir $HOME/blog
cd $HOME/blog
git clone https://github.com/dpsnowden/blog.git
```

* You should now have a `$HOME/blog/blog` directory.
* Edit the `pelicanconf.py` and `publishconf.py` files and customize for your settings. 
* Edit the `./octopress-theme/templates/_includes/{about.html, twitter.html}` files and customize for your settings.

* Create a SSH keypair to use for pushing from Wakari to Github pages:
* Add the SSH public key `$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` in your Github user settings
* Add lines to `$HOME\.bashrc` to start SSH agent

* Create a custom Wakari `blog` environment with the necessary conda packages:
```
cd $HOME/blog/blog
conda create --name blog --file blog.spec
```
Note: this conda "spec" file I created by just doing: 
```
source activate blog
conda list -e | tee blog.spec
```
so it may contain some extra packages.

* Activate the `blog` environment:  
```
source activate blog
```

* Install the non-conda packages via pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* New notebooks go in `$HOME\blog\blog\content\downloads\notebooks`
* Create a new markdown file in `$HOME\blog\blog\content that points to the new notebook.  These entries look like this:
* In the directory `$HOME\blog\blog`, type `make github` to convert notebooks to html and push to gh-pages
