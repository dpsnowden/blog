Several people brought to my attention that the current `shapefiles` hosted at
[GADM](http://www.gadm.org/) are not up-to-date as the one I plotted.  Well,
they where in the past (just look at their front figure).

Apparently they updated to the same bad boundaries that are present in GMT
and basemap.  Unfortunately I cannot host the good old ones, because their
license do do allow re-distribution of their data.  That policy is kind of
against their logo "Boundaries without limits", maybe "Boundaries with some
limits would be more appropriated".

Unfortunately, I'm searching without success for a substitute.  The Brazilian
[IBGE](http://www.ibge.gov.br/english/) provide only `KML` and `KMZ` files that,
when converted, are not readable by basemap.

As soon as I find an alternative source I'll update the post.
